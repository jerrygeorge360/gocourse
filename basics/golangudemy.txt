# About GO
GO- statically typed compiled(google robert Griesemer)2009
Similar to C
memory safety and gc
competitor to rust.
# WHY GO
fastest and most efficient,approach to concurency(coroutines),perfomance(machine code directly ),readability and maintainability,modern practices,security(memory manangement and strong typing),versatility.

# CODING
## GO commands
go run

# Structure of GO
to run a go program: go run filename
to build a go program : go build filename->returns a binary executable.
main-> entry points
package main->like modules
fmt-> use for i/o outputs.
Go supports any unicode, package main is compulsory to tell the compiler it is an excutable

### Go compiler
translator for your code,handles gc,memory allocation,execution,runtime
why go runtime despite the compiler compiling directly to machine code? to manage certain aspect e.g memory allocation,gc,concurency(goroutines)
Go takes away the negatives in c and c++(manually memory allocation and concurency)
c and c++ doesn't have a runtime support.

### standard library
set of prewritten codes
to use them in go -> import "package name"
go enforces modular approach in go,i.e you must import a package to use it

### import statement
Tree shaking->used to remove dead codes,thereby reducing filesize in the final executable
namables
to import multiple packages
import ("fmt"
,"net/http")
 named import ->
import ("fmt"
foo "net/http")

# Data types
Integers,Floating Point numbers,Complex numbers,Booleans,Strings,Constants,Arrays,Structs,Pointers,Maps,Slices,Functions,Channels,JSON,Text and html templates


# variables
var age int = 10
or the gover symbol
age := 10
don't use the gover symbol with var
//Default values
// Numeric Types:0
// Boolean types:false
// String Type: ""
// Pointers,slices,maps,functions and structs:nil

## Naming conventions
PascalCase-> Structs,interfaces,enums
snake_case -> variables,constant,filenames
UPPERCASE -> constants
mixedCase -> booleans,externallibraries,

# arithmetic operations
overflow->result of computation exceeds maximum value that can be stored in a datatype
underflow -> result of computation smaller than the minimum value that can be stored in a datatype(loss of precison)

# for loop
syntax
for initialization; codition;post{

}
break -> terminates the loop
continue -> skip current iteration goes to the next

# operators
!NOT,||OR,&&AND

# if else

#Arrays
fixed sized data collection of a single type
var arrayName [size]elementType
_ -> blank identifier


multidimensional array
var matrix [3][3]int = [3][3]int{
    {1,2,3},
    {4,5,6},
    {7,8,9},
}
# slices
copy,append,make,slices.Equal,cap

# maps
var mapVariable map[keyType]valueType
mapVariable = make(map[keyType]valueType)
mapVariable = map[keyType]valueType{
    key1:value1,
}
delete,clear,
_,status := myMap["key"]->checks if a value is associated with this,returns true or false
maps.Equal

# range
why use it?
clean and efficient way
enhances readability

arrays,slices,strings->iterates from first to last
maps->iterates in no order
channel -> iterates until channel is closed
use blank identifier if you aren't using a value to prevent memory leaks

# functions
public functions should be UPPERCASE
private functions LOWERCASE

they are first class objects and citizens
# multiple return values
func compare(a,b int)(string,error){
    
}

# variadic functions
functions that allow you create a variable number of arguments just like kwargs args in python

... -> destructures

# defer
a defer  is a mechanism that allows you to postphone the execution of a function until the surrounding functions is returned.
practical use cases
resource cleanup
unlocking mutexes
logging and tracing
best practices
keep deferred actions short
understand evaluation timing
avoid complex control flow

# panic
panic(interface{})
