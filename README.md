# 🐹 My Go Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my personal journey of learning the Go programming language (also known as Golang).

## 📚 Purpose

As I grow in understanding Go, I am organizing my knowledge and notes into levels that reflect my current progress. This not only helps me stay accountable but also might serve as a reference for others starting their Go journey.

## 🧭 Structure

The repository is divided into three main folders based on my learning progression:

- **`basic/`**  
  Contains foundational concepts and notes such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, arrays, slices, and maps.

- **`intermediate/`**  
  Covers topics like pointers, structs, interfaces, error handling,generics and more nuanced language features.

- **`advanced/`**  
  Includes in-depth topics such as:
  Goroutines,Channels,Context,Timers,Tickers etc.

Each folder contain:
- 📓 **Notes** — My personal jottings and summaries of what I’ve learned.

## 🚀 My Goal

To build a strong understanding of Go that enables me to write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Go code — from simple CLI tools to full backend services.  
Ultimately, I aim to apply Go in real-world scenarios including:

- Building scalable and maintainable backend systems  
- Developing cloud-native applications using platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure  
- Contributing to open-source projects like Docker, Kubernetes, and other tools built with Go
