 üß† Go Language Concepts (Intermediate)

---

## üîÅ **Closures**

**Definition**
A closure is a function value that captures variables from its surrounding lexical scope, even after that scope has exited.

**Practical Use Cases**

* Stateful functions (e.g., counters)
* Encapsulation (hide implementation details)
* Callbacks (e.g., async handlers, event listeners)

**Usefulness**

* Encapsulation of logic and data
* Flexibility in design
* Enhances code readability

**Considerations**

* Memory usage (captured variables may prevent garbage collection)
* Concurrency issues (shared mutable state)

**Best Practices**

* Limit the scope of closures
* Avoid excessive use for clarity and maintainability

---

## üîÉ **Recursion**

**Practical Use Cases**

* Mathematical algorithms (factorial, Fibonacci)
* Tree/graph traversal (DFS, BFS)
* Divide and conquer (merge sort, quicksort)

**Benefits**

* Simplicity in logic
* Clarity of code
* Flexibility to model self-repeating problems

**Considerations**

* Performance (stack usage, depth limit)
* Base case must be well-defined to prevent infinite recursion

**Best Practices**

* Always test base and edge cases
* Consider optimization (e.g., memoization, tail recursion)
* Clearly define recursive and termination conditions

---

## üìç **Pointers**

**Definition**
A pointer stores the memory address of another variable.

**Use Cases**

* Modify variables indirectly (pass-by-reference)
* Efficiently pass large structs or arrays
* Direct memory management for performance-critical applications

**Declaration & Initialization**

```go
var ptr *int       // declaration
var a int = 10
ptr = &a           // initialization
```

---

## üßµ **Strings**

**Definition**
A string is a sequence of bytes in Go; strings are immutable and contain UTF-8 encoded characters (runes).

**String Types**

* **Raw strings**: use backticks (`` ` ``)
* **Interpreted strings**: use double quotes with escape sequences

**Escape Sequences**

* `\n`: newline
* `\t`: tab
* `\r`: carriage return

**Characteristics**

* Strings are arrays of runes (Unicode code points)
* Accessing characters returns the rune (ASCII if in that range)

**Operations & Methods**

* `len(s)`: returns byte length
* `utf8.RuneCountInString(s)`: counts actual characters

---

## üñ®Ô∏è **fmt Package**

**Features**

* **Printing functions**: `Print`, `Printf`, `Println`
* **Formatting functions**: `Sprintf`, `Errorf`
* **Input functions**: `Scan`, `Scanf`, `Scanln`
* **Error formatting**: embed context into errors

---

## üß± **Structs**

**Definition**
A struct is a composite type that groups related variables (fields) under one name.

**Features**

* Supports **anonymous structs** for inline definitions
* Can define **methods** on struct types

---

## üîß **Methods**

Methods are functions with a receiver (value or pointer) and are bound to types (usually structs).

---

## üé≠ **Interfaces**

**Definition**
Interfaces define method sets and represent behavior. Similar to abstract classes in other languages but without inheritance.

**Key Concepts**

* No need for `implements` keyword ‚Äî a type satisfies an interface by implementing its methods
* Enables **polymorphism** and **decoupled design**

**Exporting Rule in Go**

* Exported names must **start with an uppercase letter**

---

## üß¨ **Struct Embedding**

**Definition**
Embedding allows one struct to include another, achieving a form of composition (similar to inheritance).

**Best Practices**

* Prefer **composition over inheritance**
* Avoid the **diamond problem** (common in multiple inheritance)
* Prioritize clarity and simplicity
* Explicitly initialize embedded structs when needed

---

## üß∞ **Generics**

**Definition**
Generics allow writing functions, types, and data structures that work with any type ‚Äî without sacrificing type safety.

**Benefits**

* Reusable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
* Compile-time type safety
* No performance penalty compared to interface{} + type assertions

**Considerations**

* Use **type constraints** (`~int`, `constraints.Ordered`, etc.)
* Ensure proper documentation for generic types
* Test with multiple types to avoid hidden bugs

**Example**

```go
type Number interface {
    ~int | ~float64
}

func Add[T Number](a, b T) T {
    return a + b
}
```
